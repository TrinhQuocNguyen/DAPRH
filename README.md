# ReID_market1501

A tiny repo Re-implementing some solutions for reID problem.

 - Using market1501 dataset as the unseen domain
 - Compose some popular available dataset to custom dataset for training.
 - Test with reality domain which dataset have been contributed from [Eway-Nautilus](https://cxview.ai/)

## MixFrameworks:
	
- My own effort to enrich reID solution for my project by combining some repos.

## In Refer:

some popular repos I refined for my dataset and verify its effectiveness includes:
