# ReID_market1501

A tiny repo Re-implementing some solution for reID problem.

 - Using market1501 dataset as the unseen domain
 - Compose some popular available dataset to custom dataset for training.
 - Test with reality domain which dataset have been contributed from [Eway-Nautilus](https://cxview.ai/)
